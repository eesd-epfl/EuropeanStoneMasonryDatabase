abstract = {This paper presents an experimental campaign on multi-leaf stone masonry panels, scales 1:1 and 2:3, in both original conditions and strengthened with grout injections. The panels were subjected to horizontal in-plane cyclic loading combined with vertical loading for different pre-compression levels, and provided important information on failure mechanisms, maximum displacement capacity, shear strength and other mechanical parameters, such as shear modulus and tensile strength. Further analysis provided results on other parameters which mainly characterise the behaviour of three-leaf masonry under seismic loads, i.e., stiffness degradation, energy dissipation, and viscous damping. The main aim of this study was to gather information on the static and dynamic behaviour of three-leaf stone masonry structures in non-injected and injected conditions, in order to accurately characterise their mechanical behaviour. In particular, the effectiveness of injections of hydraulic lime-based grout as a reinforcement technique was assessed and validated. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The conservation and rehabilitation ofmonuments is amatter of important investigation, and the need for accurate structural analysis, capable of effectively predicting the structural behaviour of this type of constructions, under static and dynamic loads, is increasing. Currently there are numerous computational methods and tools, supported by different theories and strategies with different levels of complexity, computation time and cost which are available to perform such analyses. A complex analysis is not always synonym of a better result and the choice of amethod over another depends mostly on the purpose of the analysis. Thiswork aims at evaluating the capacity of a non linear continuum damage model (Faria et al. in Int J Solids Struct 35(14):1533-1558, 1998), originally developed for concrete structures, to simulate the behaviour of stone masonry structures. In particular, the seismic response of an old stone masonry construction, the Gondar church, is analysed considering different levels of geometrical and material complexity. The verification and calibration procedures use the experimental results from tests performed on stone masonry walls at the Laboratory for Earthquake and Structural Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering of Porto University and from other tests found in the bibliography (Vasconcelos in Experimental investigations on the mechanics of stone masonry: Characterization of granites and behaviour of ancient masonry shear walls. PhD Thesis, Universidade doMinho, Guimar{\~{a}}es, Portugal, 2005). The results are compared, assessing the differences and the importance of using complex tools, such as the continuum damage model, to better simulate and understand the global behaviour of such constructions. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

Among other, they include in-plane cyclic shear tests on large wall specimens. Two levels of axial load and two slenderness ratios have been considered in order to obtain both rocking and shear failure modes. Useful information for this masonry typology has been collected from the tests: strength parameters, displacement capacity and hysteretic energy dissipation properties. Attention has been devoted to the damage evolution during the test, by recording position and width of cracks for increasing values of in-plane drift.},

abstract = {Stone masonry is the oldest building material that survived until today, being used all over the world, particularly in impressive historic structures as an evidence of the achievements of ancient cultures. Stone walls are usually understood as structural elements able to withstand compression but they can also act as elements that provide resistance against in-plane wind and earthquake actions. Still, only a few experimental investigations are available in the literature, regarding the in-plane behavior of stone masonry walls under cyclic loading. The present work aims at obtaining a better insight on the behavior of stone masonry walls under cyclic in-plane loads. For this purpose, 23 walls were tested under different vertical normal stress level and different bond arrangement that represent typical walls typologies. The experimental results indicate these two factors play an important role on the in-plane behavior of stone masonry walls. In particular, ductility and energy dissipation depend significantly on the textural arrangement of the stones. It is also demonstrated that good quality stone masonry walls exhibit large nonlinear deformation capacity, with moderate damage levels. Finally, it is shown that the lateral resistance of stone walls provided by simplified analytical methods agrees reasonably well with the experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2009 ASCE.},

For the first solution three specimens were tested under axial compression load and three under compression-shear load, and for the second solution three specimens were tested under axial compression load.

Complementarily, the application of an existing numerical model, stemming from plasticity and based on a micromodeling strategy, is also presented and discussed with regard to its capacity to simulate the obtained experimental results. The model was calibrated with data collected from complementary tests carried out on specimens and prisms made of the same type of stone.

Since such structures are assumed to be representative of wider typologies, the mechanical properties of the prototypes are considered as random variables, assumed to vary within appropriate ranges of values. Monte Carlo simulations are then used to generate input variables from the probability density functions of mechanical parameters. The model is defined and nonlinear analyses are performed. In particular, nonlinear static (pushover) analyses are used to define the probability distributions of each damage state whilst nonlinear dynamic analyses allow to determine the probability density function of the displacement demand corresponding to different levels of ground motion. Convolution of the complementary cumulative distribution of demand and the probability density function of each damage state allows to derive fragility curves. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Two widely-known test methods: the diagonal compression test and the shear-compression test with existing confinement stress. The test results enabled the determination of the shear strength of the masonry before and after the application of the reinforcement. The panels strengthened with the GFRP exhibited a significant improvement in lateral load-carrying capacity of up to 1060% when compared to the control panels.
