        <h2 class="ui dividing header">Bilinearisation calculation</h2>
        <p>
            The bilinear approximation of the envelope curves was computed as described below. 
            The maximum recorded strength Vmax was identified. The effective stiffness was then defined as the secant stiffness at 70%Vmax. 
            The ultimate drift δu was determined as the drift at which the strength had dropped to 80%Vmax. If such a large drop was not attained, 
            the largest drift that was reached during the test was taken as δu. 
            The ultimate strength Vu was defined as the strength that yields for the bilinear approximation the same area below the curve as the actual envelope up to δu.
             For cyclic tests, bilinear approximations were computed for the envelopes in the positive and negative loading direction. 
             The final envelope curve was derived as follows: The final effective stiffness and ultimate strength correspond to the average of the values for the two directions. 
             For the ultimate drift, however, the minimum value of the ultimate drift in the positive and negative direction was taken. 
             When the force drop was only attained in one direction, the corresponding ultimate drift was considered for the final envelope. (Vanin et al. (2017))
