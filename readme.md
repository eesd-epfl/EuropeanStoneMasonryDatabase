# EESD Stone Masonry Database Dashboard
The aim of this web application is to give an interactive and intuitive representation of the database from the paper [Vanin et al. (2017) "Estimates for the stiffness, strength and drift capacity of stone masonry walls based on 123 quasi-static cyclic tests reported in the literature"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10518-017-0188-5).

The data consists of quasi-static cyclic tests on stone masonry walls and the graphs show the important parameters and their distribution within the database.

The database can also be accessed [here](https://zenodo.org/record/812146#.YXaBUJ5ByUl). This database is maintained and updated as new test results become available. 

The first tab consists of plots that correspond to the subplots of Figure 4 in the paper, which represents the database of shear-compression tests on the stone masonry walls.

The second tab shows the actual data of the database in a filterable data table, along with the corresponding force-displacement response curves for each line.

## Project status
The dashboard is under active development. A first version will be available by Dec 2021.

* Prototype v.1 running at [eesd-stone-masonry.herokuapp.com](https://eesd-stone-masonry.herokuapp.com/)
* Prototype v.2 is running at [https://eesd-epfl.github.io/eesd-dashboard/](https://eesd-epfl.github.io/eesd-dashboard/)

## Getting started

### Dependencies

All dependencies are located in HTML files and use CDN (online sources) to fetch required JS/CSS libraries.

A recent Web Browser is required (Chrome, Mozilla, Safari, etc.).
Using Internet Explorer will most likely result in errors.

When running locally, a local server is required.

A Python 3 HTTP Server was used to run the website locally.

HTML Javascript modules and versions are:
- C3 v0.7.20
- D3 v5.16.0
- Papaparse v5.3.1
- XLS v0.7.6
- JQuery v3.6.0
- Semantic UI v2.4.1
- JSZip v3.7.1
- JSZip Utils v0.1.0
- FileSaver v2.0.5
- Tabulator v5.0.7
- noUiSlider v15.5.0

### How to install

Nothing to install.

### How to run

Using Python3:

python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1

Go to http://localhost:8000/ to visualise the dashboard.
